The basic formula for how stats affect others should look like this:

Health
Strength
Defense
Accuracy

A base hit is calculated by multiplying strength by accuracy, and the defense against it is
calcluated by multiplying the opponents' defense and accuracy. The resultant value of subtracting 
the defense bonus from the base hit is removed from the defenders health.


A battle should consist of two cards taking turns attacking and defending.
Players should be able to make trades, as well as stake cards in battles.
The winner of a battle should receive xp to spend on new cards,
or level up current ones.

How to calculate a hit:

Factors: attackerStrength, attackerAccuracy, defenderDefense, defenderAccuracy

ex: 
  attacker: 30 strength, 50 accuracy -> baseHit 15
  defender: 30 defense, 50 accuracy -> baseBlock 15
  
  totalBaseHit -> 0.

  Without randomized factors, this fight would go nowhere.

  hit bonus: random number between 0 and baseHit -> i.e. 10
  defense bonus: random number between 0 and baseBlock -> i.e. 4

  totalHit = totalBaseHit + (hitBonus - defenseBonus)
