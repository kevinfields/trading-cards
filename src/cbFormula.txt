The basic formula for how stats affect others should look like this:

Health
Strength
Defense
Accuracy

A base hit is calculated by multiplying strength by accuracy, and the defense against it is
calcluated by multiplying the opponents' defense and accuracy. The resultant value of subtracting 
the defense bonus from the base hit is removed from the defenders health.


A battle should consist of two cards taking turns attacking and defending.
Players should be able to make trades, as well as stake cards in battles.
The winner of a battle should receive xp to spend on new cards,
or level up current ones.

How to calculate a hit:

Factors: attackerStrength, attackerAccuracy, defenderDefense, defenderAccuracy

ex: 
  attacker: 30 strength, 50 accuracy -> baseHit 15
  defender: 30 defense, 50 accuracy -> baseBlock 15
  
  totalBaseHit -> 0.

  Without randomized factors, this fight would go nowhere.

  hit bonus: random number between 0 and baseHit -> i.e. 10
  defense bonus: random number between 0 and baseBlock -> i.e. 4

  totalHit = totalBaseHit + (hitBonus - defenseBonus)



Challenges should work like this:

  Player submits a challenge to another player. They can submit to the player directly, or 
  can challenge a card directly. Either way, the player being challenged should be able to accept
  the challenge or decline it. If the player is challenged directly, they should choose one of their
  cards to play, which then sends a request back to the original player who created the challenge,
  asking them if they accept the challenge between their original chosen card or not. If not, they 
  should be allowed to rechallenge, which would then trigger another request to the user originally
  being challenged. This should go back and forth until both users agree on a match, or one user 
  declines the match entirely.
